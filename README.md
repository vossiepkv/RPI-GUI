# RPI-GUI

# Task 5.1P RPi - Making GUI

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are a great way for users to easily interact with embedded
systems. GUIs help in hiding the complexity of the hardware systems and software coding and
providing a user-friendly interface for the users to interact with smart systems.

# Hardware Required
* Raspberry Pi with OS installed
* Keyboard, mouse and monitor (HDMI) to plug into the Raspberry Pi.
* LEDs
* Breadboard and jumper wires

# Software Required
* An IDE for Python development.

# Pre-requisites
* RPi tasks 4.1P and 5.1P
* Research on how to develop GUIs for Python. Popular packages to develop GUIs are
Qt, Tkinter or Kivy (there might be others, and you are free to choose the library you
are most comfortable with). You can find many good tutorials on Youtube. Examples
are as below:
a) Qt https://youtu.be/Vde5SH8e1OQ
b) Tkinter https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap-ABFNCBoE
c) Kivy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B79miUFD_ss

#Task Objective
In this task, you will create simple GUI interfaces with Raspberry Pi. RPi supports python,
which has many GUI packages including Qt, TkInter and Kivy. As before, while this task is
focusing on Python, you can use any programming language you are most comfortable with
(and supported by RPi platform) to perform this task and future tasks incorporating a RPi. For
example, if you are using C++, Qt has a complete GUI package for C++ which is very similar
to the Python package. In this task, based on what you learnt from the video tutorials, you are
required to build a simple GUI interface to turn on one of three LED lights.
